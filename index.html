                which are harmful effects that cause environmental degradation. Environmental protection is a

                 handled carefully. The people of India are engaged in a variety of profession but agriculture or 
                 farming is the main occupation in India. In contrast, though they are the backbone of the economy
                  still they are facing many problems that not only affect them but also other people.</p>

                <p>Your article was worth the read! It's inspiring how countries around the world are finally
                     adopting eco-friendly ways, like solar and wind, to generate power. Bigger nations must
                      learn from these countries.
                    <br>The condition of most farmers is terrible. About 80% of farmers in India are marginal
                     (less than 1 hectare) or small farmers (1â€“2 hectare) category. <b> I like your Campaign </b> </p>

                        365 days of the year and I'm interested in how solar energy can translate into the creation of sustainable
                          development for economic growth and job opportunities, with minimal environmental impact. Would like
                           to know where to find information on solar energy in schools and the home. Thanks for sharing.</p>
